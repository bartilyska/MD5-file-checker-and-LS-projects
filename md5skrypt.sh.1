md5skrypt [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIpath_to_directory1\fR] [\fIpath_to_directory2\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
md5skrypt compares files and directories based on their MD5 checksums. For files it calculates the checksums and compares them. For directories it hashes the names of all files and subdirectories sorts the list and generates a unique checksum for comparison.
Users can execute the script with or without parameters. Without them it prompts a dialog window using Zenity for file/directory selection.Otherwise it just compares two given files/directories. Also it gives a warning if files/directories were not found.
.SH OPTIONS
-h Displays help for the script
.TP
-v Displays the script version

\fI./md5skrypt.sh\fR - using zenity
.TP
\fI./md5skrypt.sh /home/bartek/plik1.txt /home/bartek/plik1txt\fR - using command line for files
.TP
\fI./md5skrypt.sh /home/bartek/ /home/bartek/folder/\fR - using command line for directories
.SH EXIT STATUS
It returns that comparison was correct or incorrect
